# Overview

`albums` is an interactive tool to manage music: configurably validate and fix
tags and metadata, rename files, reformat and embed album art, import albums,
and sync parts of the library to digital audio players or portable storage

This documentation is for `albums` version **%%version_placeholder%%**.

## License

`albums` is free software, licensed under the terms of the
[GNU General Public License Version 3](https://github.com/4levity/albums/blob/main/COPYING)

## Getting started

**Installation Option 1:** In an environment with Python 3.12 or newer, run
`pipx install albums`

**Installation Option 2 _(64-bit Linux and Windows only)_:** Download the
[self-contained binary release from GitHub](https://github.com/4levity/albums/releases).
Extract the contents to a folder and add that folder to your PATH.

You can watch this
[video about how to use albums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5tBG_GaG7A).

Each album (soundtrack, mixtape...) is expected to be in a folder, or `albums`
won't be helpful.

To immediately start scanning for issues in a single album or a few albums, with
default settings, run: `albums --dir /path/to/an/album check`. Add `--fix` at
the end to see repair options or `--help` for more choices. Using the `--dir`
(or `-d`) option, no data is stored between runs.

Albums can store information about a library of music in its database. Run
`albums init` to get started. It may take several minutes to index a large
collection. Configuration settings are also stored in the database and can be
customized by running `albums config`. See [Usage](./usage.md).

## Supported Formats

**FLAC**, **Ogg Vorbis**, **MP3/ID3**, **M4A**, **ASF/WMA** and **AIFF**
containers/types are supported with standard tags. **ASF/WMA** embedded image
support is read-only. Image files (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, WEBP, TIFF, etc) in the
album folder are scanned and can be automatically converted and embedded.

## System Requirements

Installation via pipx requires Python 3.12+ and should work on almost any 64-bit
x86 or ARM system with Linux, macOS or Windows.

Binary releases for 64-bit Linux or Windows do not have any Python requirement.

Albums is primarily tested on Linux and Windows.

## Risks

This software has no warranty and I am not claiming it is safe or fit for any
purpose. But if something goes very wrong, you can simply restore your backup.
By using this software, you voluntarily assume the risk that it might:

- overwrite correct tags with incorrect info, or rename files incorrectly, etc,
  depending on configuration, use or bugs.
- create a vector for malware living in media file metadata to attack your
  computer via hypothetical vulnerabilities in libraries or your OS.
- corrupt files while changing tags due to hypothetical Mutagen bugs.
- make incomplete copies of albums if there are bugs in the sync code.
- delete entire directory trees if you use the `sync` command incorrectly with
  `--delete` **and** confirmatuin or use `--force`.
    - Even if you set the correct `sync` location, the `--delete` option could
      delete files from your digital audio player that you wanted to keep.
