# Ideas

## General features

- Select/filter albums based on stream info, recent access, etc
- Support additional file formats
- Faster scan (only update what changed, don't decompress images again)
- Dynamic collections e.g. by tag value or partial path
- Sync to predefined destinations with configuration
    - Check destination is correct
    - Transcode files during sync for preferred format/max bitrate
    - Destination library layout can be different than main library
- Option to use ID3 2.3 instead of 2.4 if people still do that
- Improve Unicode support (if there are problems?)
- Localize interface

### More checks and fixes

- many suggested fixes for current no-fix check failures in TODOs
- low bitrate or suboptimal codec
- not all tracks encoded the same (file type or kbps target)
- track filename doesn't match title, doesn't include track/disc number
- album folder doesn't match album name
- parent folder doesn't match artist if using artist/album
- automatic visual similarity check for front cover art, so it can be stored in
  multiple formats and resolutions without disabling uniqueness check
